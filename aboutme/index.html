            <p>Greetings and Salutations everyone! My name is Angela Milford, friendly
                and commonly known as "Teph", and I'm nineteen years old. I'm pursuing
                a major in Computer Science with a interest in web development and
                information technology. I enjoy listening to music, learning foreigh
                languages, playing video games, and spending quality family time. My
                current occupation is that of being a full-time, online student, and
                I can say for certain that I'm making a change in my career path by
                pursuing an educational program that's drawing me closer to my career
                goals.
            </p>
            <p>I love BYU-Idaho for making its mark in the digital world as an online
                University. It's a great for opportunity for students located in remote
                areas. I appreciate the fact I'm able to schedule the courses to tackle
                throughout the week. I'm grateful to be an online BYU-Idaho student! The
                degree I'm currently pursuing is Bachelor's.
            </p>
            <p>I'm taking this course because I was always fond of designing content and
                learning new coding languages.
            </p>
            <p>I've been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints my
                whole life.
            </p>
            <p>Pleasure to meet you all!</p>
