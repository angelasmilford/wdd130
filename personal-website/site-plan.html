      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>To provide you with a better understanding of me by exploring my heritage. Many people are unaware of the Pacific, let alone its island nations. I hope that after

        Talofa lava and Bulavinaka! In English, Greetings and Welcome! M
        y name is Angela S. Milford, but I am commonly and friendly known 
        as "Teph." I am 19 years old, and I was born and raised in the 
        smallest U.S. Territory in the Pacific: American Samoa. My ancestry 
        ties are in two Pacific Island nations: Samoa and Fiji. On this 
        website, you will get a feel for what life is like in both Samoa 
        and Fiji. I am proud to share with you about my two countries!

      <h3>Samoa</h3>
      <p>
        Talofa lava and Welcome to beautiful Samoa, Visitor!
        Welcome to the Polynesian side of Angela S. Milford. Here, 
        you will be learning about what Samoa is all about! For clarity, 
        it is important to note that there are two Samoas, one of which 
        is a sovereign nation and the other is an unincorporated territory 
        of the United States. Samoa is an independent nation in the 
        South Pacific Ocean, consisting of four main islands: Savai'i, 
        Upolu, Apolima, and Manono. It is a Polynesian nation located in 
        the central South Pacific Ocean, earning it the nickname "the 
        heart of the Pacific." Samoa, like many other Pacific Islands, is 
        rich in culture, history, and natural beauty. Samoa is rich in 
        cultural heritage. The Samoan chiefly system, called the “Matai” 
        is a hierarchical system of governance in which the chief leads 
        the village. Samoa is the only Samoan island that recognizes both 
        genders in the Matai system. Samoan traditions, core values, 
        dances, tattoos, and language are still intact and vibrant. To 
        learn about Samoa’s rich culture, press this button. The 
        national flag and government sigil of Samoa are depicted here. 
        Samoa gained independence in 1962, after a period as a German 
        and then a New Zealand territory. Samoa is a democratic nation 
        with a unicameral legislature. Samoa recently made history by 
        announcing its first female Prime Minister, Fiame Naomi Mataafa.
        To learn more about Samoa’s history, press this button.
        Life in Samoa is arduous. Samoa is more hectic than American 
        Samoa, with everyone on their feet, hustling for money to support 
        themselves or their families. Crops grown at their homes, such as 
        taro, breadfruit, mango, papaya, chocolate, and seafood, are sold 
        for monetary gain. The crops are harvested after a great deal of 
        physical labor, which explains why Samoans appear so physically 
        fit to outsiders. To learn Samoa’s way of life, watch the video 
        by clicking this button.

      <h3>Fiji</h3>
      <p>
        Bulavinaka and Welcome to Fiji.
        Welcome to the Melanesian side of Angela S. Milford. Here, you 
        will be learning about what Fiji is all about! Fiji is a 
        Melanesian nation in the South Pacific Ocean, comprising more 
        than 300 islands. The archipelago is widely recognized for its 
        well-deserved reputation as “the soft coral capital of the world.” 
        The capital of Fiji is Suva, which is on its main island. Fiji 
        has four districts, each of which is further subdivided into 
        thirteen provinces. Due to the country’s many provinces, there 
        are a variety of dialects spoken; however, the main dialect 
        practiced is called “Bauan.” Fiji, like many other Pacific 
        nations, is rich in culture, history, and natural resources. The 
        national flag and the government sigil of Fiji are depicted in 
        this image. Fiji gained its independence in 1970, following its 
        cession to the United Kingdom by the first King Cakobau. Fiji’s 
        government is a parliamentary democracy that recently elected a 
        new Prime Minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, after seventeen 
        consecutive years.This image depicts the national flag and 
        government sigil of Fiji. Fiji gained independence in 1970, 
        following its cession to the United Kingdom by the first King

        recently elected a new Prime Minister, Sitiveni Rabuka, after 
        seventeen consecutive years. To learn about Fiji’s history, 
        press this button. Life in Fiji is similar to Samoa. Because of 
        their commercial activities, Fijians are offered many job 
        opportunities.Most residents either work in commercial 
        enterprises or sell their crops at flea markets. Fiji is 
        renowned for its hospitality, and as a result of its many 
        beautiful sites, it draws many tourists who are treated with the 
        utmost care. To learn Fiji’s way of life, watch the video by clicking this button.

        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        The wireframe for the Home page is pretty straight forward. The 
        only thing that may be confusing is there being a profile of me, 
        but the sole purpose for there being a picture of me is to have a 
        self-introduction since this website is meant for people who are 
        interested in getting to know me by exploring my ethnic backgrounds.
      </p>

      <h3>Samoa</h3>
      <p>         
        Samoa and Fiji have the same wireframe since they both present 
        the same concepts, though have different approaches. The three 
        images listed horizontally explain the history, and way 
        of life.
